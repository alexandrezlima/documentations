| SwapTargetManually             | Swap the target based on the coordinates direction. Open this function to see the coordinate system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IsLockedOn                     | Returns the bool that informs if the owner is currently locked on. Not replicated. For replication call the function "isLockedOnREPLICATED".                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| IsLockedOnREPLICATED           | Returns the bool that informs if the owner is currently locked on, REPLICATED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| GetTargetInfo                  | Returns information about the current locked-on target:  -bool informing if the current target is valid -its reference -the lockedon socket -the target direction                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SetTarget                      | Given a target, if it has the target component, it will be set as the new target (if already locked-on, unlocks the current target and then set the new target).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| UnlockTarget                   | Unlock the target (marks bIsLockedOn as false, locked-on target reference to null, resets character rotation and clears the current timers).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| InvalidateTarget               | Given a target, invalidate it (setting its "isTarget" variable as false).  For replication (network use), the current target MUST replicate (target blueprint -> class defaults -> replicates). You can mark the boolean "bAutoReplicateTarget" to replicate it automatically.                                                           |
| Softlock                       | Rotates the owner to face the best target possible at a given rate (if "rotate character" is true), without locking the camera.  Rate must be in a range [0, 1]. A rate of 0.5, for example, will rotate half way.  Returns the found target and its direction.  Returned actor can be null, so the "bSuccess" indicates if it is valid. |
| InvalidateCurrentTarget        | Invalidates the current target (setting its "isTarget" variable as false).  For replication (network use), the current target MUST replicate (target blueprint -> class defaults -> replicates). You can mark the boolean "bAutoReplicateTarget" to replicate it automatically.                                                          |
| Find Target                    | Returns the best target based on the search method. The output can be null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| GetCameraLookingDirection      | Returns the camera looking direction (its forward vector).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GetTargetDistance              | Returns the distance between the player and the target in meters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
