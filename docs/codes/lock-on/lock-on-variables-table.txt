| StartingPlayerRotationCurve               | This curve is used to smoothly rotate the player at the target direction when locked-on. Used if the variable "bRotatePlayerAtTarget" is true and if the "PlayerRotationType" is different than "Use controller desired rotation".                                                                                                                     |
| CameraPitchRotationClamp                  | Pitch rotation has a range of [-90, +90]. The closer to 90, the greater is the pitch rotation when looking at the target.

| bClampPitchRotation                       | If true, clamps the camera pitch rotation using the range of the "CameraPitchRotationClamp" variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| CameraRotationOffset                      | Adds an offset in the camera rotation if "bRotateCamera" is true. X offers an offset in yaw and Y in pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| bShowLockOnPreview                        | If true, shows a preview reticle on the best target based on the target settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| PreviewUpdateTimer                        | If "bShowLockOnPreview" is true, this value is used to update the preview reticle.

| LockOnPreviewWidget                       | If "bShowLockOnPreview" is true, this variable defines the preview reticle that will show up on the previewed target. The preview will disappear when locked-on.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| LockOnPreviewReference                    | Saves the lock-on preview reference. If the preview is not used, this variable wil be null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
